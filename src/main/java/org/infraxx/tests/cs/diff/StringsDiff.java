    //    Write a program to find out duplicate or repeated characters in a
//    string, and calculate the count of repeatation.

//    This page gives an example to print all permutations of a given string. For example, xy would be xy and yx.
//
//    Here is the steps to implement string permutations:
//
//    Take out the first char and keep it constant. And permute rest of the characters.
//    User recursive method call to permute rest of the string except first character.
//    While making recursive call, we accumulate each character being constant along with recursive call response.
