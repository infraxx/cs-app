//    Write a program to reverse a number using numeric operations.

//    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum
//    of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive
//    divisors excluding the number itself. Equivalently, a perfect number
//    is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors.
//    The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper
//    positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6
//    is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors:
//            ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6.

//    Write a program to swap or exchange two numbers. You should
//    not use any temporary or third variable to swap.

//    Below example shows how to find out sum of each digit in the given number using recursion logic.
// For example, if the number is 259, then the sum should be 2+5+9 = 16.

//    A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors
// other than 1 and itself.
// A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.
// For example, 5 is prime, as only 1 and 5 divide it, whereas 6 is composite,
// since it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6.
//
// The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory:
// any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering.
// This theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime.

//    Below example shows how to convert string format of a number to number
// without calling Integer.parseInt() method.
// We can do this by converting each character into ascii format and form the number.
